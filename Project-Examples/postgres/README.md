### Using ElephantSQL for PostgreSQL:

1. **Sign Up for ElephantSQL**:

   If you don't have an account, sign up for a free account at [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).

2. **Create an Instance**:

   After signing in, create a new instance by clicking on "Create New Instance." Choose a plan that suits your needs; there's a free plan available.

3. **Get Connection String**:

   Once your instance is created, click on it to see details. In the details page, you will find the connection string. It will look something like this:

   ```bash
   postgres://your-username:your-password@your-host:5432/your-database
   ```

   Replace `your-username`, `your-password`, `your-host`, and `your-database` with your actual ElephantSQL credentials and database name.

4. **Use Connection String in Prisma**:

   Update your Prisma schema file with the ElephantSQL connection string:

   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("ELEPHANTSQL_URL") // Use your ElephantSQL connection string here
   }
   ```

   Set the `ELEPHANTSQL_URL` as an environment variable.

5. **Run godspeed prisma prepare command**:

   This command generates the Prisma client for your application and connects Prisma to your ElephantSQL PostgreSQL database.


6. **Start Building Your Application**:

    With the connection string and Prisma models in place, you can now start building your application using Prisma to interact with your postgres database.

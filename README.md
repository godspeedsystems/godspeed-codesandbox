This is a [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/) template to quick start using Godspeed Framework's Alpha Release. Follow below steps to use this template.

1. Signin / Signup to [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)
2. Create a new sandbox from `New Sandbox` option in dashboard.
3. Select `Import Template` and paste this link: [https://github.com/godspeedsystems/godspeed-codesandbox](https://github.com/godspeedsystems/godspeed-codesandbox) then Import.
4. This will create a spin up `hello world` sandbox with Godspeed Framework.

`Godspeed CLI` command line don't work on codesandbox. So for the best experience, Prefer using godspeed framework with `godspeed CLI` in your local machine.
    - Godspeed CLI is supported in Mac and Linux OS, Windows OS support coming soon.
    - It allows you to install plugins.

Follow along the Godspeed Documentation.
